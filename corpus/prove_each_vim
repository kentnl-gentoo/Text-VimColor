No vims specified.  Please pass directories of vim installations:
  $0 ~/vim5 ~/vim6

This will run the test suite (or anything added after "--")
with ~/vim5/bin prepended to the PATH:
  PATH=~vim5/bin:\$PATH prove -lr t
  PATH=~vim6/bin:\$PATH prove -lr t

Or
  $0 ~/vim6 -- which vim
Will just run
  PATH=~vim6/bin:\$PATH which vim
USAGE

foreach my $vim ( @vims ){
  local $ENV{PATH} = "$vim/bin:$ENV{PATH}";
  system(@prove);
}
